# Shared Home Projects Board

This repo publishes the tasks Eric wants to share with Jess. The canonical file is `board.md`. Updates made here are mirrored back into Eric's private DopaBot board (and vice versa).

## Usage
- Edit `board.md` directly in GitHub or via any Markdown editor.
- Gus/DopaBot will sync status between this list and Eric's main board.
