# Shared Home Projects Board

This repo publishes the tasks Eric wants to share with Jess. The canonical file is `board.md`. Updates made here are mirrored back into Eric's private DopaBot board (and vice versa).

## Usage
- Edit `board.md` directly in GitHub or via any Markdown editor.
- Gus/DopaBot will sync status between this list and Eric's main board.

## Guide for Jess (First-time GitHub user)
1. **Open the repo:** Visit https://github.com/emuehlstein/jne_shared_todo (log in if prompted).
2. **View the list:** Click `board.md` to see the latest shared tasks.
3. **Make an edit:**
   - Click the pencil icon in the top-right of the `board.md` view to edit in your browser.
   - Add or check off items using the same checkbox format (`- □ Task` or `- ✕ Task`).
4. **Save changes:** Scroll down, enter a short summary (e.g., “Checked off door hinges”), and press “Commit changes.” No branches or pull requests needed.
5. **Let Gus know:** If you make a significant update, drop a note in Signal so he can log it in the Dopabot board too (he’ll also sync automatically on next check-in).

If you prefer not to edit on GitHub directly, just message Gus and he’ll update the list for you.
