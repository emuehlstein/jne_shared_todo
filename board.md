# Shared Home Projects Board (Eric ↔ Jess)

_Last updated: 2026-02-14 21:32 CST_

## Jess’ Condo Fixes
- □ Fix door hinges
- □ Improve guest bathroom threshold
- □ Install hotel-style partial open door latch on the front door
- □ Tile guest bathroom backsplash

> These items are still tracked on Eric’s main DopaBot board for scheduling and status. Update either list, and I’ll mirror the change.

## Notes
- Use this file for anything you want Jess to see or collaborate on.
- If a task already lives on Eric’s private board, just add “(mirrors Eric’s board)” so we don’t double-track efforts.
